The process involved modelling\r\n                          and texturing, as well as implementing the final\r\n                          product into xCode to handle physical based materials\r\n                          on a number of the models. Since these models were to\r\n                          be used on a mobile application, certain guidelines\r\n                          were put in place, which made the process slightly\r\n                          trickier; for example, a minimum poly count, and a\r\n                          texture size limit. The model's ranged from anything\r\n                          as simple as a desk lamp to something bigger and more\r\n                          complex like a garden shed.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                          Here you can see an animated example of the final\r\n                          application, and how it would be used to place down\r\n                          one of the models inside a real-time space.
